# Dandified Borgor Browser
DBB is a web browser written in Python, unlike the original Borgor Browser written with the PyQt5 library, 
DBB is written with the PySide6 library, essentially being a PySide6 rewrite with prettier GUI, and a more modern Qt library.

**Be aware that Dandified Borgor Browser is a fork of the Borgor Browser, both licensed under the MIT license.**
